This is an internship object for [EyePop.ai](https://eyepop.ai/) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Demos

This project features three use cases for EyePop's product.

1. The Rapid Medical use case is a web app designed for mobile useâ€”a delivery person can scan prescription packages to verify content and delivery.
2. The CargoShot use case involves the detection of boxes and pallets
3. The Jumping Jacks demo is a consumer use case designed to drive interest from people passing by the EyePop booth

All three of these demos will be on display at San Diego Innovation Day.
